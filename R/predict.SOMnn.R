#' predict method for S4 class \code{SOMnn}
#'
#' Predicts categories for a table of data, based on the hexagonal som in the model.
#' This S4 method is a wrapper for the predict method stored in the slot \code{predict}
#' of a model of type SOMnn.
#' 
#' The function returns the winner neuron in \code{codes} for
#' each test vector in \code{x}.
#' \code{x} is organised as one vector per row and must have
#' the same number of columns (i.e. dimensions) and the identical column names 
#' as stored in the SOMnn object.
#' 
#' If data have been normalised during training, the same normalisation is applied
#' to the unknown data to be predicted.
#' 
#' Probablilities are softmax normalised by default.

#'                    for all categories and the prediction 
#'                    as category index (column name \code{prediction}) and
