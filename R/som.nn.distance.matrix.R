#' Torus distance matrix
#' 
#' Calculates the distance matrix of points on the surface of a torus.
#' 
#' A rectangular plane is considered as torus (i.e. on an endless plane that contimues on the left, 
#' when leaving at the right side, and in the same way connects top and bottom
#' border). Distances between two points on the plane are calculated as the shortest distance
#' between the points on the torus surface.
#' 
#' 
#' @param coors \code{data.frame} or \code{matrix} with two
#'              columns with x- and y-coordinates.
#'              
#' @return      Complete distance matrix with diagonal and upper triangle values.
