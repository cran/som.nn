#' Predict class labels for a validation dataset
#'
#' A model of type \code{SOMnn} is tested with a validation dataset. The dataset must
#' include a column with correct class labels.
#' The model is used to predict class labels. Confusion table, 
#' specificity, sensitivity and accuracy for each class are calculated.
#' 
#' Parameters stored in the model are applied for k-NN-like prediction. If necessary 
#' the parameters can be changed by \code{\link{som.nn.set}} before testing.
#' 
#' The funcion is only a wrapper and actually calls \code{som.nn.continue} with the test data and 
#' without training (i.e. \code{len = 0}).
#'
#' @param model    model of type \code{SOMnn}.
#' @param x        data.fame with validation data. Samples are requested as rows.
#'                 \code{x} must include the same columns as the data.frame with which the model
#'                 have been trained originally.
#'                 A column with correct class labels is needed. The column with class
#'                 lables is selected by the slot \code{class.idx} of the model.
#'
#' @return         S4 object of type \code{\link{SOMnn}} with the unchanged model and the
#'                 test statistics for the test data.
