#' k-NN-like classification with self-organising maps
#' 
#' The package \code{som.nn} provides tools to train self-organising maps
#' and predict class memberships by means of a k-NN-like classifier.
#' 
#' The functions \code{\link{som.nn.train}} and \code{\link{som.nn.continue}} are used 
#' train and re-train self-organising maps. Functions of the package 
#' \pkg{kohonen} are used for som training (see \code{\link[kohonen]{som}} for details).
#' 
#' In contrast to a normal som training, class lables are required for all
#' training samples. These class lables are used to assign classes to the
#' codebook vectors (i.e. the neurons of the map) and build a set of reference
#' vectors. This reference is used for nearest-neigbour classification.
#' 
#' The nearest neighbour classifier is implemented as predict method. 
#' It is controlled by the following parameters:
#' \itemize{
#'    \item \code{dist.fun}: the distance function to weight the distance of reference
#'          vectors and the sample to be predicted.
#'    \item \code{max.dist}: the maximum distance to be considered.
#' }
#' Some distance functions are provided in the package (linear, bubble, inverse 
#' and tricubic) but any custom function scan be defined as well.
#' 
#' The classifictaion differs from a normal nearest-neighbour classifier, because 
#' the neighbourhood is not defined by the distance between reference-vectors and 
#' sample-vectors. Instead the neighbourhood of the neurons on the som is used.
#' 
#' Because the som have been generated by an unsupervised training, the classifier is 
#' robust against overtraining. 
#' 
#' In addition the abstract model can be visualised as 2-dimensional map, using
#' the plot method.
