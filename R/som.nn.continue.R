#' Continue hexagonal som training
#'
#' An existing self-organising map with hexagonal tolology is further trained and
#' a model created for prediction of unknown samples.
#' In contrast to a "normal" som, class-labels for all samples of
#' the training set are required to build the model.
#' 
#' Any specified custom kernel function is used for som training. The function must match the 
#' signature \code{kernel(data, grid, rlen, alpha, radius, init, toroidal)}, with 
#' arguments:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{data} \code{numeric} matrix of training data; one sample per row
#'   \item \code{classes:} optional \code{charater} vector of classes for training data
#'   \item \code{grid} somgrid, generated with \code{\link[class]{somgrid}}
#'   \item \code{rlen} number of training steps
#'   \item \code{alpha} training rate
#'   \item \code{radius} training radius
#'   \item \code{init} \code{numeric} matrix of initial codebook vectors; one code per row
#'   \item \code{toroidal} \code{logical}; TRUE, if the topology of grid is toroidal
#' }
#' The returned value must be a list with at minimum one element 
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{codes:} \code{numeric} matrix of result codebook vectors; one code per row
#' }

#'
#' @param model    model of type \code{SOMnn}.
#' @param x        data.fame with training data. Samples are requested as rows and taken randomly for the
#'                 training steps. All
#'                 columns except of the class lables are considered to be attributes and parts of
#'                 the training vector.
#'                 \code{x} must include the same columns as the data.frame with which the model
#'                 have been trained originally.
#'                 One column is needed as class labels. The column with class
#'                 lables is selected by the slot \code{class.idx} of the model.
#' @param kernel   Kernel for som training. One of the predefined kernels
#'                 \code{"bubble"} and \code{"gaussian"} == train with the R-implementation or 
#'                 \code{"SOM"} == train with \code{\link[class]{SOM}} or 
#'                 \code{"kohonen"} == train with \code{\link[kohonen]{som}} (\code{kohonen::som}) or 
#'                 \code{"som"} == train with \code{\link[som]{som}} (\code{som::som}). 
#'                 If a function is specified (as closure, not as character)
#'                 the specified custom function is used for training.
#' @param len      number of steps to be trained (steps - not epochs!).
#' @param alpha    initial training rate; default 0.02.
#' @param radius   inital radius for SOM training.
#'                 If Gaussian distance function is used, radius corresponds to sigma.
#'
#' @return         S4 object of type \code{\link{SOMnn}} with the trained model
